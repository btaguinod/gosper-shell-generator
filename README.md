# Gosper Shell Generator

## Purpose

These notebooks create 3D structures wrapped with patterns that resemble Gosper Curves.

They also output .nom files that can be opened with [JIPCAD](https://jipcad.github.io/) so you can get 3d models of these shapes.

## Possible Improvements:
- dodecahedron generator doesn't work with other numbers of triangle cards, as some constants are hardcoded to work with a triangle length of 3
- dodecahedron has some weird twists in JIPCAD that doesn't go away with mintorsion
- move helper functions to single file
